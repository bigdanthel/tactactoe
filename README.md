# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Each player takes turns to place their mark (X or O) on an empty cell by entering a number from 1 to 9.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
